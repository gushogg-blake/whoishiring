## Whoishiring Job board

I'm using SvelteKit to make this app. Instructions below!

## Developing
```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
